<h1>Character Ideas</h1>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Briefly share character ideas and backgrounds we have so far</li>
  <li>Stats will be rolled later</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Fantasy Genre</h1>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>What aspects of the fantasy genre are you interested in?</li?>
  <li>What kind of adventures do you want to go on, thematically (e.g. pirates / jungle temples / ...)</li>
  <li>What fantasy films or books do you like, and what similarities would you like to see in this game?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Tone & Safety</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>As a rule of thumb, if this game were a film it would be rated 15, i.e. themes like sex or torture should be avoided or at least happen 'off screen'.</li>
<li>If there are any themes you don't want to see in the game, let me know (privately or anonymously is fine, if you prefer)</li>
<li>Ask for a pause if you are finding a scene uncomfortable or worry that someone else might be. We can do a script change to ensure everyone's enjoying the game</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Staying In Character</h1>
<h2>Use appropriate words</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Address each other by character names</li>
    <li>Avoid terms that wouldn't make sense to the characters, e.g: "spell slots", "AOE", "2d6", "hit points", etc.</li>
    <li>Try to narrate some of your character's actions (<i>"I check for tracks in the dirt or freshly broken plant stems"</i> is preferrable to <i>"I roll my +3 Survival skill to look for clues"</i>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>What you say at the table is what your characters are saying out loud (unless it's obviously describing an action: "I climb the ladder", or a rules question)</li>
    <li>Nearby NPCs and monsters might overhear you, and conversely if characters are positioned far apart you might not hear each other</li>
    <li>Time passes while you discuss things - both in and out of combat - so strategic planning mid-combat should be kept to a few 'free action' words</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>EncourageRefocusing</h2>
<p>
Jokes, phone notifications, and general chaos is bound to break the flow sometimes - and that's fine - but try to refocus quickly and prompt others to do so too if needed
</p>

<h2>MiscStuff</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>You're welcome to do accents and/or acting if you want but your don't have to</li>
    <li>You don't have to be eloquent and silver-tongued in the real world to play a character with those traits (just like you don't have to be muscular or able to do magic in the real world to play that kind of class!)</li>
    <li>Say something like "pause" or "time-out" if you want a brief stop, e.g. to check a rule</li>
    <li>Anyone can call for a longer break at any time</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>House Rules</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Floor dice don’t count. No exceptions.</li>
<li>
Your alignment doesn't inform your play style, rather your play style informs your alignment
<ul>
    <li>Periodically, as a group, we will discuss and choose an alignment for each character based on their recent actions</li>
    <li>NB: Some class abilities and magic items may be affected by your alignment. The rule text will say so if this is the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can have a do-over on what your character says or does if only a few seconds have gone by and no new information has been revealed</li>
<li>Players who take part in the recap will start the session with inspiration. Also if I forget to award inspiration when something suitably dramatic happens then please request it!</li>
<li>Rule of cool will generally win out over rules as written, but don’t expect consistency. The GM reserves their right to be fickle.</li>
<li>
Feel free to make any reasonable assumptions about the people and objects in the scene
<ul>
    <li>e.g. At a harbour you don't need to ask <i>"Are there any crates or barrels nearby?"</i>, just proceed as if there are and we'll all mentally add them to the scene.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
If you want to push your luck with a less plausable but not game-breaking change to the scene you can use your inspiration to request it. These should make for a cool moment but not feel 'cheaty' or make a challenge unreasonably easy. e.g:<br>
Suitable examples:
<ul>
<li><i>"It suddenly starts raining"</i></li>
<li><i>"There's a chandelier which I swing from as I leap from the balcony"</i></li>
</ul>
Not gonna happen:
<ul>
    <li><i>"I find a chest containing 10,000 gold pieces at my feet"</i></li>
    <li><i>"An ancient bronze dragon appears and fights at my side"</i></li>
</ul>
NB: either way, DM veto applies!
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>World Building</h1>
<p>
'World' doesn't necessarily mean an entire fantasy planet. For our purposes the world of our campaign is probably just a small handful of countries or kingdoms, and more specifically a few towns and interesting landmarks within those regions.
</p>
<p>
We'll go around the table each answering a few prompts from the following question lists and sketching representations of our answers onto a map was we go:
</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>What natural landmark inspires awe?</li>
<li>What structure is shrouded in mystery?</li>
<li>What is the most dangerous town to live in?</li>
<li>Where would you travel to find something rare?</li>
<li>What place reminds you of the real world?</li>
<li>Is this world an unusual shape?</li>
<li>What place is untamed by civilisation?</li>
<li>Where would someone hide a valuable treasure?</li>
<li>Where would a traveller go to relax?</li>
<li>What place or thing do people make pilgrimages to visit?</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p>
<ul>

<li>What powerful organisation might your character deal with cautiously?</li>

<li>If you burned most of your bridges, who would you turn to for help?</li>
<li>Who guards secrets that you might want to know?</li>

<li>Which antagonistic group is more complicated that it appears?</li>
<li>Which organisation supports the arts?</li>
<li>What gang, tribe, or faction is just fun to hang out with?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Rumours and Mysteries</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>What threat goes by many names?</li>
<li>Which living figure do some believe to be dead?</li>
<li>Which dead figure do some believe to be alive?</li>
<li>How does the sun rise and fall?</li>
<li>What ruin defies explanation?</li>
<li>What natural event seems to conflict with our understanding of nature?</li>
<li>What lost treasure has claimed the lives of many who sought it?</li>

<li>What great threat waits to be awakened?</li>
<li>What skill provides mysterious power?</li>
<li>Where does one seek unknowable truth?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>
We'll roll our character stats together, in person. However, You can do point buy or standard array if you prefer (even after seeing the results of your dice rolls!)
</p>

<h2>Roll Stats</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest.<br>e.g. [3, 5, 1, 4] = 3 + 5 + 4 (dropping the 1) = 12</li>
<li>Repeat this process until you have generated six values</li>
<li>Assign those values to your character's six primary ability scores</li>
<li>Remember to adjust the values for any Race and Class modifiers that may apply</li>
<li>Record ability modifiers:
<ul>
    <li>A score of 10 or 11 give an ability modifier of 0 (i.e. no modifier)</li>
    <li>Every even number above 10 grants +1</li>
    <li>Every odd number below 10 represents -1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Previous Adventures</h2>
<p>
Write a very short plot summary for an adventure your character previously embarked on, as if it were a comic book or movie (but shorter - a couple of sentences is fine).
<ul>
    <li>What was at stake / who or what was threatened?</li>
    <li>Who was the antagonist(s) / what was the nature of the threat?</li>
    <li>What was a skilful, cool, or heroic thing your character did during the adventure?</li>
    <li>Why was the outcome of the adventure both good and bad?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Joint Ventures</h2>
<p>
Repeat the above steps twice more, each time collaborating with one other player. At the third step both characters should state one heroic thing they did during the adventure.
